### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸŽ’ I'm a full-stack developer working on a large-scale financial product as part of a feature team.
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on designing a repostiory manager. Making repositories private/public/archived can be tiresome, so something to make that a lot easier. Once the design is ready, I'll create it using React, and Node JS on the backend.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning UI/UX design, design patterns, and Spring Boot.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on projects that make lives easier, whether it's through developer tools, productivity tools, or applications that solve a problem really well.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with production grade security.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything related to full-stack development, and becoming a developer.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: you can leave an issue or get me on twitter at [madebyibrahim](https://www.twitter.com/madebyibrahim)
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him
- âš¡ Fun fact: My cousin almost shot me (accidentally, I should add) with an AK-47. Good times.
